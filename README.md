This is an app which allows you to create an image like the one below

It gives three text areas (Title, Subtitle 1 & Subtitle 2), A large profile image & allows multiple smaller images along with a gradient background.

The app currently has translations for:
- English
- Japanese
- Spanish

This was just a project to let me experiment with Winforms, implementing multiple languages & image manipulation in C# so it won't be perfect or get many updates & fixes.
